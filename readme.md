## üì¶ Installation

Choose the installation method that best suits your Linux distribution.

### 1. Debian / Ubuntu and derivatives (.deb package)

This is the recommended method for Debian-based systems.

**a) Critical Prerequisite: Enable 32-bit Architecture** The SNX binary is 32-bit and will not work on a 64-bit system without multi-arch support. This is a mandatory first step.

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
```

**b) Install the Package** Download the latest `.deb` file from the [Releases page](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/igorsuzart/snx-connect/releases "null") and install it using `apt`. `apt` will automatically handle all required dependencies.

```
# Replace with the actual downloaded file name
sudo apt install ./snx-connect-gui_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb
```

You can now find "SNX Connect" in your applications menu.

### 2. Arch Linux and derivatives (AUR)

This is the easiest method if you are on Arch Linux or a derivative like Manjaro.

**a) Enable the `multilib` repository:** The SNX binary is 32-bit, so you need to enable the `multilib` repository. Edit your `/etc/pacman.conf` file:

```
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Then, update your system:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

**b) Build and Install the Package:** Clone this repository and run `makepkg` from the project's root directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/igorsuzart/snx-connect.git
cd snx-connect
makepkg -si
```

The `-s` flag will automatically install all required dependencies from the official repositories, and the `-i` flag will install the package after a successful build.

You can then find "SNX Connect" in your applications menu.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Launch the "SNX Connect" application from your menu.
    
2. Enter your VPN server address, username, and password.
    
3. Click "Connect".
    
4. Once connected, you can manage specific IP routes that should be tunneled through the VPN via the header menu.
